    Please don't play that nigga songs in this party, I can't even listen to that<br>
    Anytime that I ran into somebody, it must be a victory lap, ayy<br>
    Shawty come sit on my lap, ayy, they sayin' Drizzy just snapped<br>
    This in between us is not like a store, this isn't an closeable gap, ayy<br>
    I've seen some niggas attack, and don't end up makin' it back</p>";

    Point at the nigga who act like a killer, but you only one from the neck<br>
    I'm like the DaBaby, I'm not just a rapper<br>
    You play with me you will get stretched, ooh-oh<br>
    Ran dracs in the hood, surround Drake around dracs<br>
    Even though I got a case, I'ma do what it take<br>

Know they be lyin', a hundred percent<br>
Moved out of Ritz and forgot 'bout the Bent<br>
Valet just call me to tell come get it<br>
I knocked that boy off and I don't want no credit<br>
If it was me, they wouldn't regret it<br>
Left me for dead and now they want dead it, yeah<br>
Heart is still beatin', my niggas still eatin'<br>
Backyard it look like the Garden of Eden<br>
Pillow talk with 'em, she spillin' the tea<br>
And then shawty came back, she said she didn't mean it<br>
It's hard to believe in</p>";
